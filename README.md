# Description
The other day, I visited a website that I had visited no more than a month ago, when I discovered to my horror that it had been removed.
This site was supposed to be the launchpad for a new project, and without it, this project will now take much longer (and be much more difficult).
So instead of getting a jump on this new project, which would have been wise since it will take longer and be more difficult, I instead decided to avenge this travesty with some vibe coding.

Introducing the Pocket Wayback Machine!
The PWM is a Chrome extension that marries two of the most critical tools of any modern-day netizen; the Wayback Machine Internet Archive, and the browser history.
Whenever you visit a page, PWM automatically downloads an offline-accessible version of the site for you to revisit anytime in the next 30 days or whenever you delete it (feature under construction), whichever comes first.
Naturally, we automatically blacklist certain pages, and you can add to this blacklist as needed.

# Dependencies
